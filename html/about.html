						<p>I'm an astrophysicist, graduate student, musician, martial artist, programmer, writer, and explorer. I've been a researcher, physics tutor, laboratory instructor, resident assistant, class president, librarian, furniture salesman, and fry cook. I'm pursuing a dream and it ends in outer space &mdash; perhaps even on another world.</p>

						<p>I'm working to earn a doctorate, get my wings, and become an astronaut.</p>

						<p>I've earned a BA in astrophysics from Franklin &amp; Marshall College and an MS in physics from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I'm currently earning a PhD in physics at UTRGV. I work primarily in the fields of time domain astrophysics and observational astronomy.</p>

						<p>I'm from rural southeast Pennsylvania. On my father's side, I'm third generation Sicilian-American. On my mother's side, I have Italian, Pennsylvania Dutch, and Irish ancestry. I'm working on digitizing my family tree. I have a <a href="http://gabriellecamuccio.com/index.html" target="_blank">sister</a> who is an artist and designer, and I have cat named Liliko'i.</p>
