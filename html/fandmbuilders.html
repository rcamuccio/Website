						<p><b>STUDENT MAKER SPACE</b></p>

						<p>There was a spare room in the Hackman Physical Sciences Laboratories at F&amp;M that contained supplies needed for a proper maker space &mdash; an open lab space where students could work on STEM-related projects and showcase their results. It contained everything from a double pendulum, 3D printer, K'NEX, LEGOs, Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and soldering kits. With departmental support and some small funding, we were able to start a few interesting projects in the newly-designated Student Maker Space.</p>

						<p><b>BUILDER TEAMS</b></p>

						<p>A team of students built a LEGO replica of the Large Hadron Collider and made a poster display out of it. Another team of students repaired a previously-damaged drone, and made plans for entering into a drone competition. One student learned how to use a 3D printer and AutoCAD for producing custom prints.</p>

						<p>A <a href="http://fandmbuilders.weebly.com/" target="_blank">website</a> was made for the group with links to all of the projects and members.</p>
